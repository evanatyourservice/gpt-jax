Jax GPT
=======

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) in Jax/Flax.

One of the goals of this project is to try out [`jax.experimental.pjit`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/08-pjit.html). I'm curious about the performance differences for model size and distribution configurations.

more to come ...
